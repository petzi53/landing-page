I am a professor of Education Technology and was for 13 years head of the Department of Interactive Media
and Educational Technologies at Danube University Krems. I am currently on a sabbatical (2018/2019).
<br /><br />
My research interests are Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL), eLearning, eEducation,
design of educational scenarios, taxonomies of educational patterns.
Recently my research focus has shifted to the development of science in the internet era:
eScience, science 2.0, open science, open scholarship.

I launched my English weblog already in Summer 2017, but it is still experimental. With this website, I want to focus on R related issues and tools for reproducible research to foster education in Open Science & Data Science.
<br /><br />Not only the English language barrier has to overcome, but I also have problems to know what particular target community I want to address. Furthermore, there are still some unresolved technical issues with the sophisticated technology behind the static web generator. And last not least, my learning curve on the relatively new subjects continues to be steep and challenging.

Open Science with all their flavors (Open Data, Open Research Workflow, Open Research Methodology, Open Evaluation, etc.).
This new focus also includes strategies to foster reproducible research using the R language for estimation statistics.
